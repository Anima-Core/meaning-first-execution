# meaning-first-execution
Meaning-First Execution (MFEE) is an evaluation harness for measuring how often high-capacity transformer inference can be safely avoided without changing outputs. It provides reproducible, black-box validation of transformer equivalence, compute reduction, and economic impact under realistic workloads.
